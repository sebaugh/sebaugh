## 👋 Hi, I’m Sebastian

I work at the intersection of data science, decision-making, and human behavior. With a background in Mathematics and Sociology, my work combines quantitative modeling, simulation, and machine learning to study complex systems and human–system interaction.

I primarily use R and Julia for statistical modeling and simulation, and I am expanding into Python-based machine learning and AI methods. My current interests include simulation-based modeling, optimization, and computational approaches to behavioral and qualitative research.
