- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sebaugh I hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Sociology, and I currently pursue a masters degree in Quantitative Methods and Information Systems. I'm interested in data science and social psychology with regard to decision making. I'm mostly experienced using R and Julia, currently working on improving in Julia based simulations and broad Machine Learning using Python.
- Currently my focus is on applications for PhDs so there is not much going on here, but I'm always eager to work on interesting projects with practical applications.
